# You pick the bits, I hide the file

**Date**: 2025‐05‐14

**Problem**  
While playing around with some steganography scripts, I found myself wanting to see things like how many bits I needed to change before the change was apparent. I also wanted to see how much stuff I could put in an image if we discard the idea of it being noticable. I put the whole text of "Moby Dick" in a screenshot. I wanted to see what it would look like to use the most significant bits instead of the least, it was a funny thought that some programmer could get his right and left mixed up.

**Solution**
